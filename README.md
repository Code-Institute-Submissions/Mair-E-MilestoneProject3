    ## UX
    
    ### Goals
    The target audience for CookBook are:
    - People interested in cooking from home and trying new recipes which are regularly updated.

    User goals are:
    - Easily work out the purpose of the website.
    - Easily navigate the website..
    - Owner of the site to become an admin user.
    - Admin user to add/edit and delete recipes..  
    - Contact the website admin.

    CookBook fills these needs by:
    - Each page has a header with the title and cookbook image so it is asy to understand the focus of the website.
    - There is a fixed navigation bar at the top of each page to direct the user as well as buttons in the body of the page to go back and forth.
    - There is a hidden register page for the owner to register as an admin user and then they can navigate to the login page froom the nav bar.
    - When admin is logged in they have access to the Add recipe page aswell as edit button which enables them to edit and delete a recipe.
    - Providing a contact form as well as links to social media of the admin user, myself.

    ### Design

    ### Wireframes
    I created wireframes to assist me when building my HTML page layout.
    Desktop, mobile, tablet

    Updated wireframes if layout changes
    ### Data Design
    This project uses relational database, meaning each collection is directly related to one another. 
    ### Visual Design
    #### Fonts
    Example
    - The primary font...
    - The secondary font...

    #### Icons
    Image
    - Icons are taken from the [getbootstrap](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/i) Icon library and are utilised as classes in the `<i>` tag.
    - As they are utilised as classes, they can easily be styled using other classes or IDs in the same tag. I often used Bootstrap classes to style them uniformly.
    - I have used the instagram, facebook, twitter and linked in icons in the footer. These direct you to the main home pages but ideally the owner would have profiles on each one.
    - Each page has a simple icon above its title to give a pictorial idea of what the page's use is.

    #### Colours

    ## Testing
    Testing can be conducted either manually or automated and each has its own pros and cons.
    - Manual
        Pros
        - Simpler. Less training and program knowledge is required.
        - User testing. Performed by humans so helps in usability testing.
        Cons
        - Time. Can take a lot of time up.
        - People. Requires people resource as complete by the tester/developer.
        - Limited. Errors may be missed as human error will come into it.

        Manual testing is used for low volume, exploratory testing where the deveoper wants to test the usability.

    - Automated
        Pros
        - Quicker. Hundreds of tests can run in a short space of time.
        - Efficient. Helps detect errors earlier as written before the software.
        - Specific. Edge cases can be accounted for.
        - Reliable. Results are accurate and repeatable.
        Cons
        - Limited. Only as good as the questions we ask.
        - Function Only. Doesn't test the User Stories.

        Automated Testing is use for high volume, repeatable testing to test performance.

    I have chosen to primarily use manual testing for my web page.

    ### Methods
    Validation
    - HTML
    - CSS
    - Links 
    - Javascript
    
    General Testing
