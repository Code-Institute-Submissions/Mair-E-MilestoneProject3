    ### Design

    ### Wireframes
    I created wireframes to assist me when building my HTML page layout.
    Desktop, mobile, tablet

    Updated wireframes if layout changes
    ### Data Design
    this project usesa  relational database, meaning each collection is directly related to one another. 
    ### Visual Design
    #### Fonts
    Example
    - The primary font...
    - The secondary font...

    #### Icons
    Image
    - Icons are taken from the [Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/) Icon library and are utilised as classes in the `<i>` tag.
    - As they are utilised as classes, they can easily be styled using other classes or IDs in the same tag. I often used Bootstrap classes to style them uniformly.
    - I have used the linked in icon in the footer for my social account.

    #### Colours

    ## Testing
    Testing can be conducted either manually or automated and each has its own pros and cons.
    - Manual
        Pros
        - Simpler. Less training and program knowledge is required.
        - User testing. Performed by humans so helps in usability testing.
        Cons
        - Time. Can take a lot of time up.
        - People. Requires people resource as complete by the tester/developer.
        - Limited. Errors may be missed as human error will come into it.

        Manual testing is used for low volume, exploratory testing where the deveoper wants to test the usability.

    - Automated
        Pros
        - Quicker. Hundreds of tests can run in a short space of time.
        - Efficient. Helps detect errors earlier as written before the software.
        - Specific. Edge cases can be accounted for.
        - Reliable. Results are accurate and repeatable.
        Cons
        - Limited. Only as good as the questions we ask.
        - Function Only. Doesn't test the User Stories.

        Automated Testing is use for high volume, repeatable testing to test performance.

    I have chosen to primarily use xxx testing for my web page.

    ### Methods
